Rules:
> First, select your hero character. The character you choose will determine your sidekick options.
	
> Next, pick your sidekick. Each sidekick affects your hero's stats in different ways.
	
> Each level, you will face off against a different type of monster. 
  
> You must complete three rounds to continue to the next level, but choosing to play more rounds give 
      you the chance to increase your stats.
      
> You can choose to specialize or attack normally at the beginning of each turn. 
	
> Specializing increases your attack, but lowers your defense, so choose wisely.
